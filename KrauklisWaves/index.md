# Krauklis Waves in Synthetic Fracturs

Over the past decades, volcanic seismology has shown that subsurface fractures act as acoustic resonators: seismic tremors arising from natural or induced excitation contain rich information about the fracture geometry. These resonances are governed by Krauklis (tube) waves propagating within the fluid-filled aperture. In collaboration with [C. Armando Duarte](https://cee.illinois.edu/directory/profile/caduarte) developed an experimental technique and numerical solver to generate and monitor the propagation of Krauklis waves in synthetic fractures.

**Summary of our work:**

- **Derived** a closed-form theory for Krauklis-wave speed and attenuation in an idealized planar fracture.  
- **Implemented** this formulation in a numerical simulator that predicts the frequency response of fractures without empirical fitting.  
- **Experimentally validated** the model at seismic frequencies on finite-extent fractures, demonstrating near-perfect agreement with no free parameters.  
- **Extended** the theory to account for finite-size effects, showing that the original scaling laws for infinite fractures hold with minor corrections.

These results provide the first direct experimental confirmation of decades-old Krauklis-wave theory and establish a robust framework for non-invasive fracture characterization in both volcanic and petroleum contexts.
